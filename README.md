# Weather-Prediction-Temperature
This project aims to predict weather parameters, specifically temperature, using historical weather data and machine learning models. Developed as part of an academic group assignment, it includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

Project Structure:
1. Weather_Prediction code.ipynb: Main notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing steps, model building, training, and evaluation.

2. Weather Prediction(Data Set).csv: The dataset used for training and evaluating the model.

3. Weather_Prediction_Temperature__Group-15.pdf: Project documentation with methodology, results, and observations.

Key Features:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. Machine Learning Model for Temperature Prediction

4. Evaluation Metrics for Model Performance

5. Visualizations to support insights

Technologies Used:

1. Python

2. Jupyter Notebook

3. Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

4. Scikit-learn
